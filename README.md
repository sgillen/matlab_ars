Augmented Random Search for Reinforcement Learning in Matlab.

This repo contains an implementation of [Augmented Random Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055) in Matlab. It supports Matlab environements compatible with the [Matlab RL Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/reinforcement-learning.html). It also requires the [Parallel computing toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html).
